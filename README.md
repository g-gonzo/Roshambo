## Roshambo_Csharp (Rochambeau)
Rock, Paper, Scissors or Rochambeau is a child’s game of chance using your hand to form a Rock, Paper or Scissors and when displayed to your opponent, a winner is declared. 
## Motivation
I was looking for a project that was hopefully quick and easy to get up and running with C#.
 ## Build status
